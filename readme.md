# 404B Lesson 4 Assignment 4A

## Instructions

### Split VS Code Window

You can drag `main.py` tab to the right side of the window to split the window into two panes. This will allow you to see the instructions and the code at the same time.

### Answering

You can answer the questions by writing your answers in the `main.py` file.

You can run the code by clicking the `Run` button on the top right corner of the editor.

The output will be shown in the `Terminal` tab at the bottom of the editor.

## Your Task

Complete the function `find_min_max(...)` in `main.py` which accepts a list of integers, find the minimum and maximum values and return them as a dictionary.

`main.py`:

```python
# ✅ Complete this function, replace `pass` with your solution:
def find_min_max(numbers) -> dict:
    pass

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 2, -1, 5]
list2 = [21, 2.5, -3, -2, -1, 5.1]

result1 = find_min_max(list1)
result2 = find_min_max(list2)

print(result1)  # --> {'min': -1, 'max': 5}
print(result2)  # --> {'min': -3, 'max': 21}
############### ❌ DO NOT change these lines ###############
